## Results
### Results on Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
Based on the chart created from the table data for the *Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date*, it is best to launch a campaign in May or June in order to get the best possible outcome. 
Also, we can assume that September through December seems to be the worst time to launch a campaign, highlighting that in October was the highest in failed campaigns.
### Results on Outcomes Based on Goal
Looking at the *Outcomes Based on Goal* chart, we can conclude that highest successful campaigns have a goal of less than $1000, whereas the lowest successful campaigns lie in the $45,000 to $49,999 goal.
